## It packs plugins in layers

 * E.g. all JS related stuff together and with a sane enough config.
 * Each layer has documentation.
 * It is easy to create your own layer if you need to (And you now `elisp` a
   bit)
 * Layers for tons of basic stuff (Ruby, JS, React, Git, linting,
   autocompletion...)
 * Layers for lots of stuff you can't live without and you don't know yet
   (restclient, git gutter)
 * Others (games, nyancat, xkcd, email, irc... )
