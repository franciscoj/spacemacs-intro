## Which layers help when working on redbooth

* ruby (with some extra config to integrate rbenv and rspec)
* html (it add suport for almost everything JS related)
* react (need to explain it?)
* markdown
* puppet
* syntax-checking (Adds support for linting on your files)
* version-control, git (yes, both)
* github (To integrate with gist)
* restclient (To use curl like a pro)
