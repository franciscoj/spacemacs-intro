## Which layers I use?

* `ruby` (with some extra config to integrate rbenv and rspec)
* `html` (it add suport for almost everything JS related)
* `javascript` and `react`
* `markdown`
* `puppet`
* `syntax-checking` (provides syntax check and linting for many languages)
* `version-control`, `git` (yes, both)
* `github` (To integrate with gist)
* `restclient` (To use curl like a pro)
