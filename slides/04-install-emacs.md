## How to install emacs:

### Linux

Install the `emacs` package from your distro. Don't install `xemacs` it's not
emacs, it is an old and outdated fork.

### Mac OSX

```sh
brew install emacs
brew linkapps
# Some other mac stuff might be required, sorry :(
```

### Check whether it is properly installed

```sh
emacs --version # => This should be >= than 24.4
```
